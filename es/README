Incoma
======

Incoma is a free software debate platform whose aim is to facilitate conversations between thousands of people simultaneously, to allow the construction of a real global collective intelligence.

The default index.php version is the PHP/MySQL version of Incoma which uses the MySQL database to store the conversations. A local version without PHP/MySQL can be executed loading index-local.html without no installation.

Try Incoma in its main page: [incoma.org] [1]


Installing and understanding Incoma
===================================

For using the local version nothing needs to be installed, just copy the files and open index-local.html from any browser.

For using the PHP/MySQL version you need to configure the MySQL database of your server. Information, definitions of the tables and scripts for configurating the database can be found in the folder incomadb-installation.
Do not forget to configure the file incomadb.conf with the configuration info of your database.

Information about all the files and folders can be found in the file README.structure
