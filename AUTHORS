INCOMA is a project emerged from a strange simultaneous lucid dream of Carlos Barragan del Rey and Miguel Arana Catania, that was developed through hundreds of conversations, carefully watered with tea and soft transcendental music.
The first prototype was built during Interactivos?'13 with the kind invitation of Medialab-Prado and the collaboration of Andreas Vox, Francisco Sanz Garcia and Frederic Janssens.
After it, the first beta version was finished thanks to the fact that Carlos and Miguel do not need to sleep at night.
We want to thank the Theoretical physics department of UAM for its contribution with the project (although they don't know it). We want also to thank the no-grupo (no-group) who beta-tested the first version.

You can find more information in the Incoma project blog: blog.incoma.org. If you have questions, suggestions, if you find a bug, want to share something nice with us, or anything else, please write us to the e-mail on top.
Remember that Incoma is FREE SOFTWARE (free as in Braveheart). So it is yours and of the rest of the humanity. Because everything is a remix. Because we love the 99%.

Enjoy!
